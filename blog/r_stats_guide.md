One of Hakai’s core themes that cross-cuts each research axis is ‘Big-Data and Modelling’. Our ability to gain insight from our long-term ecological data sets is limited only by our capacity to integrate, and digest data. To that end, this guide was developed to serve as a foundation from which to build the internal technical capacity — using a coherent and systematic approach — to turn data into insight, understanding, and ultimately knowledge about the ecosystems we study.

Through this guide you can learn data wrangling skills, R programming basics, project workflow and organization, mapping in R, reproducible research techniques, and collaborative analysis development in an open-science context.
